## Explanation

The code defines an LED pin  and an interval  for blinking the LED.

The LED is connected to pin 7.

In the setup() function, the LED pin (pin 7) is configured as an output using pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT).

The loop() function is where the LED blinking occurs.

It turns the LED on  and waits for the specified interval using delay.

Then, it turns the LED off  and waits again for the same interval.


## **Conclusion:**

This code snippet creates a simple LED blinking effect with a 1-second interval.

If you upload this code to an Arduino board with an LED connected to pin 7, the LED will blink on and off at the specified interval.
